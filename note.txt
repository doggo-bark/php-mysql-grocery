can't start mysql in xampp? -> already have mysql install, stop the mysql service, open xampp and try to start mysql again.
(sudo) service mysql status/start/stop

htdocs? the default root of the app 

create files in htdocs: add.php, connect.php, ...
basic html structure ! enter




use VScode plug-in live server instead of xampp? 
    Probably no. VScode works mainly in static webpage but also works with dynamic webpage(web dong) like php, nodejs, asp.net. But they are not the same thing https://www.quora.com/Can-I-use-Visual-Studio-Code-instead-of-XAMPP
    TRY later.

print php query error:
    $result=mysqli_query($con, $query);
    if (!$result) {echo("something is wrong: " .mysqli_error($con));}
	
put php code above html, don't know why, but .e.g:
    <?php if (isset($_POST['btn'])) ...
    <html> <input type="submit" name='btn' ...
    both command refer to the same 'btn', the 'btn' in the current .php file

since php and html are mixed like 
    <?php if ... { ?>    <html></html>     <?php  }  ?> then probably code execution is linear
    also the php code run linear, some php code is above to get some variables so below php code have something do deal with
    (if isset 'btn' ) at the top but the 'btn' is down below??
